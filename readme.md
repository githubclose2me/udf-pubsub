#Writing to a named Pipe in UDF
##Problem
You want to emit an event when you perform an operation a single record, but there is no in-built
way to do this in Aerospike.
##Solution
Perform the operation via a [UDF](https://docs.aerospike.com/display/V3/User-Defined+Function+Guide), and write and event message to a named pipe. 
Construct a shared library in C that writes to a named pipe, 
this library will be called from the Lua UDF. See [Calling C from a UDF](https://docs.aerospike.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3807960#LuaUDFâ€“DevelopingLuaModules-ModuleswritteninC).
Construct a reader for the named pipe to process the event.
### Build steps
#### Step 1
Clone the GitHub repositry at <some place>
#### Step 2
Build the as_publish.so by running the script:
```
./build_linux.sh
```
#### Step 4
Copy the as_publish.so to the directory /opt/citrusleaf/usr/udf/lua on each node in your cluster. 
__Important__ C mondules are not automatically registered or propogated to all nodes in the cluster, you need to do it manually.
